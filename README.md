The code can be run by Python V3.8 on a desktop computer with any operating system and only the Numpy package is needed.
The sample input for running the calculation of water scarcity index for the TRB was provided. The "basin.txt" contains the basin ID, 
the "availability_grid_05_sba_1_12_ssp370_correct_basin.csv" contains the water availability data,
and the "withdrawl_grid_05_1_12_sba_basin.csv" contains the water withdrawal data.
The output is the water scarcity of each TRB and the expected run time is few seconds.
